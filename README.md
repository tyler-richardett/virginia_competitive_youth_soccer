# Competitive Youth Soccer in Virginia

In the wake of the U.S. men’s national soccer team's failure to qualify for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, an unimaginable series of events left supporters, former players, and members of the media trying to make sense of it all. Some responses were measured—others impassioned, delivered in the heat of the moment. But most shared a common thread: frustration with the country’s youth development system.

More specifically, there emerged a collective assault on “pay-to-play,” a structure which, some argue, limits access for low-income children of color to high-quality, competitive soccer. But let’s say, for the sake of argument, the pay-to-play problem suddenly vanished. Would the U.S. talent pool suddenly become more diverse? Or would other barriers stand in the way?

Using data from competitive youth soccer league schedules, the U.S. Census Bureau, and the clubs themselves, this project seeks to identify such trends for the state of Virginia.

The final project is located [here](https://tricha3.shinyapps.io/youth-soccer-virginia/), and the process files are available in this repository.

## Fees

This folder contains source information for the fee data included in the original dataset. The cost assigned to each team represents a combination of team and club fees charged to the players of each team for a full year (i.e., one spring and one fall season) of play. This value excludes uniform, travel, hotel, and tryout expenses, as well as membership fees collected on a per-family basis. All other associated were included.

## Figures

This folder contains the figures created using the ``ggplot2`` package and exported for presentation within the final project.

## Process Files

This folder contains the R code used to analyze trends within the data, as well as CSV files saved along the way.

## Schedules

This folder contains the original HTML and CSV files exported from the schedule pages of each league in the study. It also contains the R code used to isolate and clean the necessary information from those schedules.
